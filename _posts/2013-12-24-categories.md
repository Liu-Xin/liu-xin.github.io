"Hello, World!"

Yeah, I know its over done and stereotypical, but I really could not thing of a more fitting first phrase for my first blog post on my first website.

I'm currently a junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science. On this website, I'll primarily upload blog posts of two categories, casual and technical. In posts with the casual tag, they'll mostly be about my travels and leisures. The posts with the technical tag will be about what I learn in the field of computer science or mathematics from my classes, or outside study.

Please give my page a follow, if interested, and make sure to keep an eye out for new updates!
