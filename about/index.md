I'm Andrew, a senior at Purdue University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

I enjoy learning about different topics on the theoretical side of computer science. I'm on the CAM2 research team at Purdue, where we use machine learning algorithms and computer vision to analyze a network of public global cameras. Over the past semesters, our team worked on creating a web crawler to pull images from traffic and tourism websites, and trained a model to determine which images originate from network cameras. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing volleyball as well as watch anime.

On this website, I'll be maintaining a blog (which will be updated once in a blue moon), and also my contact info if you want to reach out to me.

大家好！我是一位大學生。目前在普渡大學念計算機科學系。如果想聯繫我的話，下面有我的聯繫方式和簡歷。
